Force.com SOQL Popup
====================

Force.com SOQL Popup is an extremely raw Google Chrome Extension that I created with the intention of making my life less miserable when I needed to run queries across multiple Salesforce organizations during the day. 

This is merely a POC to learn how to make a Chrome Extension, and is nowhere near production ready (unescapaed JSON being dumped into HTML, no parsing of joined results, horrible error handling, doesn't persist data when popup closes, etc.). Fork and play with at your own caution.
